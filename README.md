# Project Title

This is a POC for a ReactJS app with bootstrap-css-only, SCSS and FontAwesome for my website retroactives.com.  Thsi project will probably be abandoned because I am not convinced that ReactJS is suitable for an eCommerce site, but it was fun and will be fun to continue working on it.


## Getting Started
[npm install] in the project directory should setup all the dependencies.
